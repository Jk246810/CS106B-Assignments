One error that I ran into was in boggle computer search with having to find all possible words. I was running into an error where noting was being added to the set what i realized is I had to choose and unchoose twice in the method which was a confusing structure to adhere to. 

Another error I ran into is in doctors without order for some reason the map printed out 0 hours for both the patients and doctors, as a result I retraced through the code with print statements and figured out that I was subtracting from the doctors hours and never adding them back when I was done. For the patients having zero hours this was a confusing error because I never edited the patients values. I first tried to print the hours at the end and they all printed out correctly which made it more confusing as to why the map was printing out 0 hours for the patients. In the end I realized I had to put a copy of the patients vector into the recursive function because if I didnt then the values were lost.
