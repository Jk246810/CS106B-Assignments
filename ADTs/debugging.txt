One bug I encountered was when I was creating the map of arrays of strings. When testing I loaded the tiny.txt file and printed out the generated map and compared it to the given map in the handout and it was not exact. As a result I tried many methods to debug, but the method that resulted in me finding my error was by grabbing and pencil and paper and manually tracing through the lines of code for creating the map. This way I was able to tell that my logic had gotten confused in the function, thus resulting in a inexact map. So, I was able to fix the logic and generate a matching map.
