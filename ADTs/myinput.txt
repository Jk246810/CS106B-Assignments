Duck Song

A duck walked up to a lemonade stand
And he said to the man, running the stand
"Hey! (Bum bum bum) Got any grapes?"
The man said
"No we just sell lemonade. But it’s cold
And it's fresh
And it’s all home-made. Can I get you
Glass?"
The duck said,
“I’ll pass”.
Then he waddled away.
Waddle waddle waddle
'Til the very next day.
Bum bum bum bum ba-bada-dum
When the duck walked up to the lemonade stand
And he said to the man running the stand,
"Hey! (Bum bum bum) Got any grapes?
The man said,
"No, like I said yesterday
We just sell lemonade OK?
Why not give it a try?"
The duck said,
"Goodbye."good day
Then he waddled away.
Waddle waddle waddle
Then he waddled away.
Waddle waddle waddle
Then he waddled away
Waddle waddle waddle
'Til the very next day.
Bum bum bum bum ba-ba-dum
